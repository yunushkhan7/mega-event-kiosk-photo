## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

`npm run package:win` to create executable files for Windows
`npm run package:linux` for Linux
`npm run package:osx` for OS X.

Note : Please be a little bit patient here. The packager needs to download some required files to package everything for each platform.
After that you can find the executable files inside the packages folder.
